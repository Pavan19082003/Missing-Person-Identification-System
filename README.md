# Missing-Person-Identification-System

## Overview
This project is an academic mini project developed as part of a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.  
The system aims to assist in identifying missing persons using **face recognition techniques** and automated notifications.

## How It Works
- Users upload or capture an image of a person
- The system preprocesses the image (grayscale conversion, resizing, noise removal)
- Facial features are extracted and compared against a stored database
- If a match is found, an **automated email alert** is sent with detection details

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Face Recognition  
- Machine Learning (Computer Vision basics)  
- SMTP (Email Alerts)
